Autonomous Documentation:

  The goal of the current autonomous implementation is to score with a set of pre-loaded balls in the low goal. This is accomplished by orienting the robot towards the goal, driving to it, and dumping the pre-loaded balls. The robot is oriented by making a decision on which starting square it is on using an ultra-sonic sensor (the robot must be placed facing the wall or not facing the wall, depending on where it is). Orientation with respect to the border wall is crucial.
  
  Orienting the Robot:
  
    1) face the net
    
    2) if the robot is on the left square, turn it towards the inside of the arena
    
    3) if the robot is on the right squre, turn it towards the closest barrier of the arena
    
  Program Overview:
  
    1) check distance between wall and robot
    
    2) use this information to find starting square
    
    3) run macro to deliver balls from given position
    
    4) wait for user control period
